Property Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

Overview : The Property Price Prediction project utilizes Simple Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict real estate prices based on various factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and other features. This model helps in estimating the price of properties efficiently and accurately based on historical data.

Features : Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw real estate data for better accuracy. Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features that influence property prices. Model Training: Implementing Multiple Linear Regression to train the model. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²). Prediction Interface: Providing a simple interface to input property details and get price predictions.

Technologies Used : Python (for data processing and model development) Libraries: pandas (Data Manipulation) numpy (Numerical Computation) matplotlib & seaborn (Data Visualization) sklearn (Machine Learning Model) Jupyter Notebook

Model Training & Evaluation: Data Preprocessing Handling missing values and outliers. Encoding categorical variables. Feature scaling. Model Implementation Splitting dataset into training and testing sets. Applying Multiple Linear Regression to find relationships between features and property prices.

Evaluation Metrics: MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures squared differences to penalize large errors. R² Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variability in the dataset.
